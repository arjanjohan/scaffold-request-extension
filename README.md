### Tailwind color scheme

SE2 Extensions currently do not allow custom tailwind configurations. You can manually replace the themes in `packages/nextjs/tailwind.config.js` by the code below to get the Request Network color scheme:

```
themes: [
      {
        light: {
          primary: "#0BB489", // dark green
          "primary-content": "#F9FBFF", //White
          secondary: "#0BB489",
          "secondary-content": "#F9FBFF",
